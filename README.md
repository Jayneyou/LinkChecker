## Usage：
1. Click browse button to select the PDF file for checking or enter webpage link.
2. Click confirm button to start checking, a progress bar will be moving with the program working properly. Depending on the file size and the amount of content on the webpage, this process can take from 20 seconds to 3 minutes.
3. A broken link report with page numbers and inaccessible reasons will then be generated, as well as a txt file under the same directory of the PDF file. For webpage links, this txt file will be in the same folder of the program file, with provided article titles to locate the links.
